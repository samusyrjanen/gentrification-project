            curve in Helsinki?

          <p>
            A map of Helsinki looks (almost uniformly) dull, and doesn't
            really tell you which areas to look into, does it?
          </p>
          <p>
            A map like this might help you get from Sörnäinen to Eira,
            but it isn't especially useful as it is when it comes to real
            estate investment.
