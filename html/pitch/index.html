            Buying, renovating, and reselling old residential properties
            in a growing city like Helsinki
            is profitable almost without an exception.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, picking just the right place to buy, renovate, and resell
            might help boost profits -- and who would not want that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Operating in areas becoming more affluent might help because
            gentrification means prices rising faster than in other parts of the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a map of Helsinki looks (almost uniformly) dull when it's just a map.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, while a map like this might help you get from Sörnäinen to Eira,
            it is not especially useful as it is when it comes to real
            estate investment.
