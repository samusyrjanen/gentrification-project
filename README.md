# DATA11001 Mini Project: Gentrification in Helsinki

Project team: Michaela Söderholm, Sami Laine, and Samu Syrjänen.

## Deliverables

This mini project tries and predicts gentrification for each postal code area in the Helsinki city (proper)
by using time series found in two open data sets (c.f. [data/README.md](data/README.md)), and
[displays the resulting predictions on a map of Helsinki area](https://samusyrjanen.github.io/gentrification-project/).

The visualisation code is in [index.html](index.html), and the data manipulation code can be found in
scripts located in the subdirectory [scripts](scripts).

The mini project report can be found in the file [doc/REPORT.md](doc/REPORT.md), and a mini project
canvas can be found in the file [doc/Mini Project Canvas.pdf](doc/Mini Project Canvas.pdf).
